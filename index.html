            What a cunt she is. I have always loved the word cunt, rather sexist but so diminishing, and the way it fills your mouth every-time you say it. Cunt. Starts off with a sharp ‘K’ sound, from the top of your throat, clean and crisp; followed by an opening ‘A’ that expands and rises into the air to only rapidly descend and become the once again blade-like sound combination of ’N’ and ’T’. Precision. I’ve always admired precision and wit, and she had plentiful of those. She carefully threads her word. I don’t know if I hate or admire her, but certainly has some qualities I do not possess and I wish I had. But trust, some things are genuinely hateful, like the way she ties her hair up thinking it’s so cool and unseen before, nonchalant, or how unaware she is that spits while speaking, or even that sometimes – and this is perhaps not entirely her fault – she oddly smell of carrots. Someone told her she looks nice when she ties he hair up like that and she believed them, because her intelligence doesn’t erase her innocence.

            The floor of an office building, at night, diaphanous and with pillars scattered throughout the floor in equal way, is painted in a clinical blue light. Each time the snow storm blinked in its quarrel against the city, the lights of the street reflect and refract into white and blue lights that cross the window walls of the building. Snowflakes crash against the glasses, and the pillars project oblique shadows on the floor. There’s an impassivity in the office that strikes as stoic when compared to the ferocity of the storm. The vacant, almost free-furniture floor is covered with a heavy silence, sepulchral and monastic, with the exception of two mattresses arranged in front of the west line of window walls. The left mattress has blue stains; on the other one lies a woman. She’s almost naked, has brain fog and a line of coke set next to her.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since there’s nothing on the vast floor, she can hear her own body: she listens to the drops of water falling in her stomach, reverberating. The body always does half of what she needs. Never fulfilling, just half-baked. Enough to keep her going, not really living. Whatever activity she’s carrying out with her body, there’s a lethargic motion she’s not able to get rid off, because she’s also quite unaware of where it’s coming from.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let me give you an example, simple yet illustrative: when she cries, she always does it for a minute or two, and her eyes become moist and, if anything, if she’s lucky enough, one drop may slowly roll down her cheek. Therefore, crying was not really an activity with neither cleansing nor cathartic effect, but enough for her body to empty itself, restarting the process of saving up again until the next semi-implosion. She did hope for these moments to extend and to deepen, for them become a moment of release, something she never met.
        </p>

        <p>
            She’s here because a series of events in her life have led her to the state of immobility, giving her life to the inaction.

            He showed up, this little Devil, for the first time when I was a kid of no more than 10 years, with a contract in his hands. Since his apparition, he’s suffused my life with apathy, an indifference towards the world I surely know it’s always misunderstood. He has a sickle in his hands and wears a Prada black office suit. Is the Devil Italian? He first told me he had a beautiful mirror, through which the most beautiful aspects of life diminished into horrific little things, while the worst would aggravate, growing hideous and hideous by the minute. He then told me, confessed to me, that it was when he, the Devil, tried to raise the mirror to God, that him and his angels made the mirror quiver and shatter into billions, and even more pieces. Ever since the pieces float in the air, like white swarming bees levitating, almost invisible, for no one to notice. But they are they there, in the space, working the light, refracting and painting everything in frosty blue. The Devil has a sickle, on his back, and he looks old: there’s an spectrality, something old, with two black suns instead of eyes. This Saturnian Devil promised to freeze time, to stop it, to not let it move one single second forward. I did find that offering so attractive… I think. I must have. I shouldn’t have. He opened his hand, and there it was: a piece of the mirror. I signed the contract, because I found the offering compelling. I think. I must have. I shouldn’t have. He then grabbed me by the hair and lifted me in the air like I was nothing, he pulled me closer to him and pushed one of the pieces in me. The Saturnian silence expands, passes through me and varnishes my bedroom with it, goes up the walls, to the mosaic, and turns it into a cloister.

            From the office building, and looking out the window at the titanic battle of lovers, in the building in front, there’s a scaffold from a renovating company to fix the east façade of the building that had been eaten away by time and sun. On top, with her dead crystalline eyes, she sees three workers eating a warm sandwich each, unbothered by the storm as if the belligerent fight didn’t exist to them, didn’t concern them, didn’t apply to their lives.
        </p>

        <p>
            These buildings embody the arrogance of mankind, a race that killed its humanity with ambition and replaced it with merits. Who has the largest dick?
