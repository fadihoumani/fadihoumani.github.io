            What a cunt she is. I have always loved the word cunt, rather sexist but so diminishing, and the way it fills your mouth every-time you say it. Cunt. Starts off with a sharp ‘K’ sound, from the top of your throat, clean and crisp; followed by an opening ‘A’ that expands and rises into the air to only rapidly descend and become the once again blade-like sound combination of ’N’ and ’T’. Precision. I’ve always admired precision and wit, and she had plentiful of those. She carefully threads her word. I don’t know if I hate or admire her, but certainly has some qualities I do not possess and I wish I had. But trust, some things are genuinely hateful, like the way she ties her hair up thinking it’s so cool and unseen before, nonchalant, or how unaware she is that spits while speaking, or even that sometimes – and this is perhaps not entirely her fault – she oddly smell of carrots. Someone told her she looks nice when she ties he hair up like that and she believed them, because her intelligence doesn’t erase her innocence.

           The floor of an office building, at night, diaphanous and with pillars scattered throughout the floor in equal way, is painted in a clinical blue light. Each time the snow storm blinked in its quarrel against the city, the lights of the street reflect and refract into white and blue lights that cross the window walls of the building. Snowflakes crash against the glasses, and the pillars project oblique shadows on the floor. There’s an impassivity in the office that strikes as stoic when compared to the ferocity of the storm. The vacant, almost free-furniture floor is covered with a heavy silence, sepulchral and monastic, with the exception of two mattresses arranged in front of the west line of window walls. The left mattress has blue stains; on the other one lies a woman. She’s almost naked, has brain fog and a line of coke set next to her.
	Since there’s nothing on the vast floor, she can hear her own body: she listens to the drops of water falling in her stomach, reverberating. The body always does half of what she needs. Never fulfilling, just half-baked. Enough to keep her going, not really living. Whatever activity she’s carrying out with her body, there’s a lethargic motion she’s not able to get rid off, because she’s also quite unaware of where it’s coming from.
	Let me give you an example, simple yet illustrative: when she cries, she always does it for a minute or two, and her eyes become moist and, if anything, if she’s lucky enough, one drop may slowly roll down her cheek. Therefore, crying was not really an activity with neither cleansing nor cathartic effect, but enough for her body to empty itself, restarting the process of saving up again until the next semi-implosion. She did hope for these moments to extend and to deepen, for them become a moment of release, something she never met.
	She’s here because a series of events in her life have led her to the state of immobility, giving her life to the inaction.

           He showed up, this little Devil, for the first time when I was a kid of no more than 10 years, with a contract in his hands. Since his apparition, he’s suffused my life with apathy, an indifference towards the world I surely know it’s always misunderstood. He has a sickle in his hands and wears a Prada black office suit. Is the Devil Italian? He first told me he had a beautiful mirror, through which the most beautiful aspects of life diminished into horrific little things, while the worst would aggravate, growing hideous and hideous by the minute. He then told me, confessed to me, that it was when he, the Devil, tried to raise the mirror to God, that him and his angels made the mirror quiver and shatter into billions, and even more pieces. Ever since the pieces float in the air, like white swarming bees levitating, almost invisible, for no one to notice. But they are they there, in the space, working the light, refracting and painting everything in frosty blue. The Devil has a sickle, on his back, and he looks old: there’s an spectrality, something old, with two black suns instead of eyes. This Saturnian Devil promised to freeze time, to stop it, to not let it move one single second forward. I did find that offering so attractive… I think. I must have. I shouldn’t have. He opened his hand, and there it was: a piece of the mirror. I signed the contract, because I found the offering compelling. I think. I must have. I shouldn’t have. He then grabbed me by the hair and lifted me in the air like I was nothing, he pulled me closer to him and pushed one of the pieces in me. The Saturnian silence expands, passes through me and varnishes my bedroom with it, goes up the walls, to the mosaic, and turns it into a cloister.

           From the office building, and looking out the window at the titanic battle of lovers, in the building in front, there’s a scaffold from a renovating company to fix the east façade of the building that had been eaten away by time and sun. On top, with her dead crystalline eyes, she sees three workers eating a warm sandwich each, unbothered by the storm as if the belligerent fight didn’t exist to them, didn’t concern them, didn’t apply to their lives. Inclemencies of the weather aggravate at every second, swooshing winds, throwing snowflakes like ice darts pointed against the numerous glass skyscrapers. A battle of metal and ice. As if she was witnessing two past lovers reuniting to sort things out, or as if the icy wind was pissed at the skyline of modern constructions built too strong for her pointless assaults.
	These buildings embody the arrogance of mankind, a race that killed its humanity with ambition and replaced it with merits. Who has the largest dick?
	The workers finish their sandwiches, and as kids, they start making ice balls and throwing them at each other, until one of them breaks one of the windows, provoking that whole glass window side of the building to burst in pieces that land on the scaffolding. The breaking glass brings her back to herself, to her body.
	A bunch of compelling thoughts race towards the finish line. Her eyes get sucked inwards and she's thrown in
	The first thought is her mother. Her whole family, really, but her focus is placed on her. 
	Context: 21pm.
	Big wide avenue.
	Steep slope.
	Four lanes: two lines of cars coming down, two lines of cars coming up. She’s on the backseat of the car, her mom is driving. They’re on the middle lane, on the side of the cars going up. The car is pretty old, the lights are red, and her mom is positioned first in line, ready to dash as soon as the lights turn green. But when they do, the car breaks down. Stops. Halts. Starts going downwards. Backwards. The break works, it only takes her mom a bit to react, a bit too much. So much so that the car behind is not able to react, and her mom’s car crashes against it right before pushing the break.
	The lights go yellow.
	The lights go red.

        On a journey today to a neighboring town. The geography is sharp like a blade. In spite of what seemed to be a journey full of wonders, this trip would soon prove to be an ill-fated one. I have a tendency to sit at the back of the bus; because it has one's back. From here I am a watcher of all. I look up to the sky and behold a grey sun behind clouds. The train goes through pine and eucalyptus forests. Everything is white. I look up again. I can see the sun has become bigger. The more I stare at it, the bigger it becomes. I sense a lack of comfort; all sound has been taken out. The sun approaches the train and no else seems to notice, like a volcano in the sky about to explode. The plane gets warmer and I fix my eyes on the airco. It’s been turned on. The sun manages to smuggle in between the clouds, shining directly unto the bus. The plastic melts by the sudden high temperature. And I start sweating. I hate sweating. I feel there's a waterfall in my back; my shoulder blades are rocks and my hair the origin of a cascade. I have a sudden desire to scream. The melted plastic turns solid due to the cold air from the plane's ventilation. The warm temperature makes it melt again, and it solidifies again, and remelts, and resolidifies, turned into an endlessly changing fluid form. One drop of melted plastic falls on my head and gets mixed with my hair. The desire of screaming returns but I don't do it. The people in the train start to melt along with the bus. The windows shatter. Melted plastic keeps falling on my head, drop, by drop, by drop, by drop, by drop, by drop, by drop as the sun approaches relentlessly. The top cover of the truck disintegrates as a crashing wave of plastic and metal that falls over me. I’m left in the middle of a hill, with a gigantic white sun in the sky. On my head the plastic and metal have turned into a big crown. Around me, the once-verdant land, has become a barren white desert. The waterfall on my back has increased into a stream of sweat running behind me; a very long and wide river that falls down an abyss left after the plane crashed. The river of my back is falling down this abyss. I start walking, elongating the river, and amidst this sterile landscape, the fertile salty water of my river brings new life. I see how, around the riversides, there’s a strong scent travelling through the air all the way up to my nostrils. What I smell is a mix of clove, cardamom and star anise. Bits of these begin to emerge from the soil. The now gone pine and eucalyptus trees are being quickly replaced by a new forest of warm spices. No plants. Only the spices. Big chunks of cloves, of between one and two meters of height, start covering the riversides, like trees and bushes. Out of many branches of the higher clove-trees I see growing flowers. Takes me some seconds until I notice these are not flowers, but big pieces of star-anise, that once in full bloom start releasing a burgundy pollen that floats in the air; next to them, cardamom shells pop out the ground, some of them as big as cars, some others like shoes. Some of the shells are cracked, and the seeds inside fall out it, rolling towards the river's water that carries them all the way until they fall down the abyss where the plain where I was had crashed. With a crown and a water cape, I feel a king on this new-found territory. I still don’t comprehend the full extent of this journey. It is only by the end of it, days from now, that I understood. At this point, I simply observe the consequences.
